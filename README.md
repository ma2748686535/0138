# ELEC0138 Hospital Appointment System with Security Demo

A Flask-based web application for hospital appointment scheduling that demonstrates common web security vulnerabilities and defenses as part of the ELEC0138 module coursework.

## üè• Project Overview

This project implements a hospital appointment booking system with the following features:
- Patient registration and profile management
- Doctor accounts (by invitation only)
- Appointment scheduling and management
- Admin dashboard for doctor invitations

The system also includes demo attacks and defense mechanisms to illustrate common web security vulnerabilities.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ELEC0138-24-25-main
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python -m app.app
```

## üîê Security Demonstrations

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. HTTP Flood (DoS)
**File:** `http_flood.py`

This script demonstrates a denial-of-service attack by sending high-frequency GET requests with spoofed IPs using the X-Forwarded-For header.

**Impact:** Overwhelms server sockets, eventually crashing the web service. You'll see socket exhaustion errors (WinError 10048) and the site becomes inaccessible.

#### 2. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Files:** `cross_site_scripting_account.py` + `XSS_register_and_inject.py`

These scripts demonstrate a credential harvesting attack:
1. Registers a fake patient account with malicious JavaScript in the first_name field
2. When a doctor views this profile, a fake login popup appears (credential phishing)
3. Credentials are silently sent to an attacker endpoint

**Impact:** Exfiltrates sensitive doctor credentials through client-side script execution.

### Defense Mechanisms

Run the following command to enable all defense mechanisms:
```bash
python enable_defense_and_run.py
```

This script implements:

#### Rate Limiting with Flask-Limiter
- Limits each IP to 100 requests/minute and 10 requests/second
- Uses a custom `get_real_ip()` function to detect spoofed headers

#### XSS Mitigation
- Removes `| safe` from template rendering to auto-escape user inputs

#### Waitress WSGI Server
- Improves concurrency handling and socket management under attack

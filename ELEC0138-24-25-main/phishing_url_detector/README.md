# Phishing URL Detector

A machine learning-powered web application that analyzes URLs to detect potential phishing attempts, providing a risk assessment score.

## Features

- Real-time URL analysis
- Phishing probability score calculation
- Risk level categorization (Low, Medium, High, Extremely High)
- User-friendly web interface

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run detector.py
```

Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to access the application.

## How it Works

The application uses a machine learning model to analyze various features of a URL, including:
- Domain name characteristics
- URL length
- Presence of special characters (hyphens, underscores)
- Path structure
- Subdomain analysis
- TLD (Top-Level Domain) analysis

The model has been trained on a dataset of known phishing and legitimate URLs, and outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood that a given URL is a phishing attempt.

## Project Structure

- `detector.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `predict_helper.py`: Helper functions for URL feature extraction and prediction
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning models
  - `logreg_pipeline_model.pkl`: Logistic Regression model (primary)
  - `nb_pipeline_model.pkl`: Naive Bayes model (alternative)
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training
  - `phishing_site_urls.csv`: Raw phishing URLs dataset
  - `processed_url_data.csv`: Processed dataset with extracted features

## Risk Levels

- ðŸŸ© **Low Risk** (0.0-0.4): Likely safe
- ðŸŸ¨ **Medium Risk** (0.4-0.7): Exercise caution
- ðŸŸ§ **High Risk** (0.7-0.9): Potentially dangerous
- ðŸŸ¥ **Extremely High Risk** (0.9-1.0): Highly likely to be a phishing attempt

## Dependencies

- streamlit: Web application framework
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library
- pandas: Data manipulation
- nltk: Natural language processing
- tldextract: Domain extraction
- joblib: Model serialization/deserialization
